		<p>India has not been participating in <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa/pisa-participants.html">PISA since 2009</a>.  Here's an archived India Today's report on that matter:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250324105225/https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/india-may-drop-out-of-international-student-assessment-pisa-again-2692495-2025-03-12">India may drop out of international student assessment PISA again - India Today</a></p>
<p>So, what's PISA?  According to their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PISA is the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA
measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science
knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After being ranked 72nd out of 73 countries in 2009, beating Kazakhstan with &quot;great success&quot;, India stopped participating in PISA.  Indian officials cited two main reasons for the withdrawal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;cultural disconnect&quot;: Probably meaning that India has a different pedagogical philosophy than the &quot;West&quot;.  China was ranked 1 in 2009, BTW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misinformation regarding the language of examination:  In '09 students thought that the only language they could take the exam was English.  So they didn't perform well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2019, India was to reengage with PISA, and had decided to take the 2021 test.  The officials made sure that the misinformation regarding the language is clarified, they also chose a few schools that would participate (generally the schools are chosen from a list of eligible schools by PISA's organizing body), and also made sure that a few questions about India are included in the exams so that the students could improve their performance.</p>
<p>However, Corona hit in 2021 and it was decided to reengage in 2025.  But now it looks like it may never happen.</p>
<p>So, why would a country which is never in the bottom 2 percentile in any other international exams like the International Math/Physics/Chemistry Olympiads, GRE, TOEFL, etc. perform differently in PISA?  There is a &quot;cultural disconnect&quot; in these exams as well, right?</p>
<p>Here's my hypothesis:</p>
<p>All the other international exams mentioned are taken by candidates who specially prepare for those examinations. In Olympiads a team of 6 highly trained students represents a country, and GRE, TOEFL are taken by individuals who prepare for them specially.  In contrast, for the PISA exam however, each country draws a sample (randomly?) of 5000 students, as mentioned on the wiki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment#Sampling">Programme for International Student Assessment - Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fulfill OECD requirements, each country must draw a sample of at least 5,000 students. In small countries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>,
where there are fewer than 5,000 students per year, an entire age
cohort is tested. Some countries used much larger samples than required
to allow comparisons between regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, because of the representation by five thousand students, the exam measures the average quality of education in schools, which I believe is why India is in the bottom 2 percent.  There is a lot of talk about the IIT alumni doing well in academics outside India, but they do not represent the average education in India which exams like PISA test.</p>

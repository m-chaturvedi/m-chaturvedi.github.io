    <title>Why is India not participating in PISA?</title>
    <link href="https://m-chaturvedi.github.io/blog/006/" />

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;India has not been participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa/pisa-participants.html&quot;&gt;PISA since 2009&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&#39;s an archived India Today&#39;s report on that matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250324105225/https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/india-may-drop-out-of-international-student-assessment-pisa-again-2692495-2025-03-12&quot;&gt;India may drop out of international student assessment PISA again - India Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#39;s PISA?  According to their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PISA is the OECD&#39;s Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA
measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science
knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being ranked 72nd out of 73 countries in 2009, beating Kazakhstan with &amp;quot;great success&amp;quot;, India stopped participating in PISA.  Indian officials cited two main reasons for the withdrawal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;cultural disconnect&amp;quot;: Probably meaning that India has a different pedagogical philosophy than the &amp;quot;West&amp;quot;.  China was ranked 1 in 2009, BTW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation regarding the language of examination:  In &#39;09 students thought that the only language they could take the exam was English.  So they didn&#39;t perform well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, India was to reengage with PISA, and had decided to take the 2021 test.  The officials made sure that the misinformation regarding the language is clarified, they also chose a few schools that would participate (generally the schools are chosen from a list of eligible schools by PISA&#39;s organizing body), and also made sure that a few questions about India are included in the exams so that the students could improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Corona hit in 2021 and it was decided to reengage in 2025.  But now it looks like it may never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why would a country which is never in the bottom 2 percentile in any other international exams like the International Math/Physics/Chemistry Olympiads, GRE, TOEFL, etc. perform differently in PISA?  There is a &amp;quot;cultural disconnect&amp;quot; in these exams as well, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s my hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other international exams mentioned are taken by candidates who specially prepare for those examinations. In Olympiads a team of 6 highly trained students represents a country, and GRE, TOEFL are taken by individuals who prepare for them specially.  In contrast, for the PISA exam however, each country draws a sample (randomly?) of 5000 students, as mentioned on the wiki, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment#Sampling&quot;&gt;Programme for International Student Assessment - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill OECD requirements, each country must draw a sample of at least 5,000 students. In small countries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland&quot; title=&quot;Iceland&quot;&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg&quot; title=&quot;Luxembourg&quot;&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;,
where there are fewer than 5,000 students per year, an entire age
cohort is tested. Some countries used much larger samples than required
to allow comparisons between regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, because of the representation by five thousand students, the exam measures the average quality of education in schools, which I believe is why India is in the bottom 2 percent.  There is a lot of talk about the IIT alumni doing well in academics outside India, but they do not represent the average education in India which exams like PISA test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>&quot;The problem with India&quot;</title>
    <link href="https://m-chaturvedi.github.io/blog/005/" />
    <updated>2025-06-28T13:58:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://m-chaturvedi.github.io/blog/005/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A former classmate wrote on LinkedIn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with India is that for every one guy  working 8 hours a day,
there are 10 willing to do 16 hours and it becomes the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree with what he said, his observation can be analyzed further.  He&#39;s
assuming that the only way to measure productivity is the number of hours
invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of machines this model of measuring productivity doesn&#39;t hold.  For
example, the sum total of the number of hours invested by all the employees to
create the first iteration of Google search would be much less than the sum
total of the time saved by the them (and the users) to search websites they
were looking for using Google search. The creation of a search engine would
lead to an increase in productivity in the long-term. This is true for many
software tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that comes to mind is that of, vim. Very creative software
engineers who created tools like vim ended up saving millions of hours in text
editing for themselves and for other engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My former-batchmate&#39;s model of estimating productivity doesn&#39;t take into
account the amount of time saved by working for fewer hours but doing creative
work, which ends up saving a lot of time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point to keep in mind is that the cause of creativity is boredom.  If
one is always doing repetitive work and does not have any free time to reflect,
they will not be creative. So, I think &amp;quot;the problem with India&amp;quot; is that the
Indian companies don&#39;t know how to nurture or leverage creativity, and have a
wrong model of measuring productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>&#39;Working very hard&#39; and programming</title>
    <link href="https://m-chaturvedi.github.io/blog/004/" />
    <updated>2025-06-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://m-chaturvedi.github.io/blog/004/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across this Zen story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sofoarchon.com/10-short-zen-stories/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your martial system.
How long will it take me to master it.” The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.” Impatiently, the student answered,
“But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice every day, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?”
The teacher thought for a moment, “20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be true for programming as well. If a programming task needs to be finished quickly because of some underlying reason which comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;thinking fast&amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot;thinking slow&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot be finished at the expected rate, because one would start creating work by introducing bugs and finishing the task would take more time than it would have if there wasn&#39;t a need of finishing it at speed.  There must be some XKCD for this which I can&#39;t find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets mad at my asking questions what&#39;s the point of fighting?  I get
embarrassed by her answering, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it&#39;s not the questions that make her mad, and the answers that
embarrass me, but it&#39;s my questioning that makes her mad, and her answering is
what I find embarrassing.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://franpritchett.com/00ghalib/201/201_07.html&quot;&gt;Prichett&#39;s page for the couplet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

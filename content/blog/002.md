_Unhe saval pah zum-e-junoon hai, kyun ladiye_ \
_Hamen jawab se qat-e-nazar hai, kya kahiye_

She gets mad at my asking questions what's the point of fighting?  I get
embarrassed by her answering, what can I say?

Note that it's not the questions that make her mad, and the answers that
embarrass me, but it's my questioning that makes her mad, and her answering is
what I find embarrassing.  [Prichett's page for the couplet.](https://franpritchett.com/00ghalib/201/201_07.html)

Reminds me of Jigar (1st couplet):

_niyāz o naaz ke jhagḌe miTā.e jaate haiñ_ \
_ham un meñ aur vo ham meñ samā.e jaate haiñ_

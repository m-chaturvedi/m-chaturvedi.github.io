# 'Working vey hard' and programming

I came across this Zen story, [here](https://sofoarchon.com/10-short-zen-stories/):

> A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your martial system.
> How long will it take me to master it.” The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.” Impatiently, the student answered,
> “But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice every day, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?”
> The teacher thought for a moment, “20 years.”
